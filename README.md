# thesis-assessment

## Instructions for viewing website

The project uses a barebones docker-express configuration to allow for easy startup of the static file server that serves `index.js` and its associated static asset files. Simply run `docker-compose up` and visit localhost:80 to view the  active webpage.

## Location of static files

If it is just the static files `index.js` and associated assets that are desired, their location is in [src > app > public](https://github.com/dashielmansfield/thesis-assessment/tree/master/src/app/public).
